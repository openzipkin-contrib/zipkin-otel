# zipkin-otel
Shared libraries that provide Zipkin integration with the OpenTelemetry. Requires JRE 11 or later.

# Usage
These components integrate traced applications and servers with OpenTelemetry protocols
via interfaces defined by [Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin).

## Collectors
The component in a zipkin server that receives trace data is called a
collector. A collector decodes spans reported by applications and
persists them to a configured collector component.

| Collector                          | Description                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [collector-grpc](./collector-grpc) | Implements the [OTLP/gRPC protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlpgrpc) |
| [collector-http](./collector-http) | Implements the [OTLP/HTTP protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp) |

## Server integration

If you cannot use our [Docker image](./docker/README.md), you can still integrate
yourself by downloading a couple jars.

[Here's an example](module#quick-start) of integrating OpenTelemetry collectors.

## Troubleshooting

## Artifacts
All artifacts publish to the group ID "io.zipkin.contrib.otel". We use a common
release version for all components.

### Library Releases
Releases are at [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases) and  [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.zipkin.contrib.otel%22)

### Library Snapshots
Snapshots are uploaded to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) after
commits to master.

### Docker Images
Released versions of zipkin-otel are published to the GitHub Container Registry
as `ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-otel`.

See [docker](./docker) for details.
